LeetCode 547. Number of Provinces

ðŸ§  Problem Statement:
There are n cities. Some of them are connected directly, some indirectly, and some not at all.  
A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities, and no other cities outside of the group.  

You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1  
if the ith city and the jth city are directly connected, and 0 otherwise.  

Return the total number of provinces.

# ðŸš€ Example Test Case
if __name__ == "__main__":
    isConnected = [
        [1, 1, 0],
        [1, 1, 0],

# ------------------------------
# ðŸ“Š Time and Space Complexity:
# Time Complexity: O(n^2) â€” We check each pair of cities once.
# Space Complexity: O(n) â€” Visited array and recursion stack for DFS.

ðŸ”¹ Problem: Keys and Rooms (LeetCode 841 - Medium)

You are given an array `rooms` where `rooms[i]` is a list of keys in room `i`. 
Each key unlocks another room. All rooms are locked initially, except for room `0`.  

Your task is to return `True` if you can visit all rooms, otherwise return `False`.  

### Example 1:
Input: rooms = [[1],[2],[3],[]]
Output: True
Explanation:  
- Start in room `0`, collect key `1`.  
- Go to room `1`, collect key `2`.  
- Go to room `2`, collect key `3`.  
- Go to room `3`, all rooms are visited.

### Example 2:
Input: rooms = [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]
Output: False
Explanation:  
- Start in room `0`, collect keys `1` and `3`.  
- Room `2` is never reached.

--------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ”¹ Time Complexity: O(N + E)
    - N = Number of rooms
    - E = Number of keys in total (edges in the graph)
    - Each room is visited once, and all keys (edges) are processed once.

ðŸ”¹ Space Complexity: O(N)
    - Visited set stores up to `N` rooms.
    - Stack stores up to `N` rooms in the worst case.
